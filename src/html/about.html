            <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever 
                since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                 typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
                 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                  and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                 including versions of Lorem Ipsum

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p><strong>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it 
                over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
            </strong></p>
            <p>
                consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the 
                word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum 
                comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is 
                a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
                 The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes 
                 from a line in section 1.10.32.
            </p>
            <p>
                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below 
                for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum
                 et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, 
                 accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
